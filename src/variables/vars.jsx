    "We as a company and team take pride in the fact that we have come from very humble beginnings- building this organization brick by brick. None of this could have been possible without the dedication, skill and integrity of our team, and we owe all our success to the 5,000+ ladies and gentlemen who have paved the way for where AZEP stands today over our 30+ years of history. I also take this opportunity to thank all our clients and associates without whose trust and support we would not be where we are today. Today we have the distinguished recognition in the Sultanate of Oman to be one of the companies that have completed and handed over almost 100 successful projects of various scales and sectors. Another feather in our cap is that AZEP has constructed the highest number (over 50) bridges in Oman, more than any of our competitors. <br><br>At AZEP, there are continuous efforts to ensure that our employees are involved with a company that delivers excellence, is trusted, and provides room for professional growth. It is vital to remember that success requires the highest standards of corporate ethics towards everyone we work with, the communities we serve, and the environment we impact. We aim to build a culture that ensures the values which remain the foundation of our company remain intact and are only strengthened over time. This is the path we have chosen to tread for the foreseeable future towards sustainable, profitable growth whilst creating long-term value for all stakeholders. <br><br> The past few years in business globally have been more challenging than ever, and the onset of the pandemic COVID-19 has only made matters more abstruse. We at AZEP have welcomed and embraced this challenge as an opportunity. It has enabled us to re-evaluate and modify our business in a manner that we are able to offer our clients more superior and safe solutions, at even more competitive and affordable costs. We strongly believe that any company that wishes to sustain in a society must do so responsibly and has a duty to “give back” to it. The major operations of AZEP remain in the Sultanate of Oman and thus it has our highest regard and respect. <br><br>AZEP aims to be in full agreement with the Oman 2040 vision which places a strong emphasis on the In-country Value and Omanisation policies of the Sultanate. We don’t only treat these as requirements of the law but take extra steps and measure to ensure that we invest in training, developing, promoting and harnessing local talent and SMEs. We look at the years ahead of us with renewed energy, enthusiasm and resolve while staying committed to our core values of Excellence, Quality, Speed, Safety and Integrity. We are certain that by keeping at this path we will reach new hights and constantly keep improving the services we so proudly provide.",
